# GunClubVR-SaveEditor
Save editor for the Oculus Quest game "GunClub VR". Modify any save-game you want by patching in all guns and attachments, unlocking max magazine size and gun damage, or resetting your owned items (if something goes wrong, or you just want to restart for whatever reason).

#### NOTE: This program does not modify any gameplay or campaign missions, so you will not lose any in-game progress. EXCEPT!!!! if you decide to patch in a "loaded save" which is my own save-game that I've grinded out all the missions, unlocked all global and weapon specific attachments, and accumalated a huge amount of money that you won't need anyway.

GunClub VR is a single-player game and NO REAL MONEY DLC purchasables are unlocked using this program. Some people don't enjoy the repetitiveness of doing missions to unlock weapons, and aren't satisfied with sandbox mode. This allows people to use all the weapons and attachments and enjoy the game how they want.
